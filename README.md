# BU1106 Task R Vectors

## Introduction

### Overview

This week you get to work with R. 

### Editing

You can create documents and edit them directly in GitHub's web interface. This is a very convenient way of creating and editing the files. 
In most cases, the preferred way of working is to create and edit the files on your own machine. 

This week I only ask some simple R related questions, so you can copy and paste your answers into this markdown file via the GitHub website, but in the next weeks we will have to work with more complex R scripts, so GitHub Desktop will become the preferred way of working with our repositories. 

## Task Explanation

Below is today's task. We will be working with R. 
If you want to have another look at what we did in last week's class you can [watch parts of the first R class on YouTube](https://youtu.be/UoAGqb1J4FQ) (youÂ  can even turn on subtitles).

For this task, you need to provide the answers in the file you are currently reading. It is a Markdown file. More explanations about the Markdown syntax can be found [on GitHub's Mastering Markdown page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

* Under the heading _Your Task_ you will find several questions. 
* Use R or R Studio to find and test the right answers, then add them to the _Your Task_ section of this document.

**Commit early, commit often** - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. It doesn't matter if your early commits contain mistakes.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

## Your Task

You have to work on this task by yourself.

#### Question 1

Set up a vector named _modules_ consisting of the module codes of the modules you study this year. 

**Answer:** Replace this text with the appropriate R command(s).

#### Question 2

Find out the cost of the main textbook from each of these modules. 

If you are not sure which book to take just take the first book from the module's reading list. If you are not sure about the correct price just use the price you can find on the website of an online retailer or on the website of the publisher.

Set up a vector named _book_cost_ consisting of the book costs. Use the same order as you did in the _modules_ vector. 

**Answer:** Replace this text with the appropriate R command(s).

#### Question 3

Set _modules_ as the names of _book_cost_.

**Answer:** Replace this text with the appropriate R command(s).

#### Question 4

What do you need to type into R or R Studio to display the object you created, i.e. to show the book costs and the module codes?

**Answer:** Replace this text with the appropriate R command(s).
